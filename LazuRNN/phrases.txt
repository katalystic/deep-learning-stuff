Hoping to meet you,
I'm at the bus station one early morning
Trying to keep from yawning a little
I don't know your name or age
And I can't manage to talk to you
I want to know more about you
Ten seconds before departure
The door will close
Running over, you
Finally
Make it onto the bus
We've met
Oh traveling bus, carry this love
Right now I can't do anything yet
My feelings are timid
I'm glad to wait at a traffic light
So until my destination
It's a love of just ten minutes
You're two meters away diagonally to the right
Why does it feel like we're far away
Despite us being so close?
Should I talk to you?
Once we've passed that hill
It'll only be a little longer 'till my destination
The chime signaling the end rings out
It's the next stop
I don't even know yet
The door opens
If I really like you or not
To you
For now I just...
It's goodbye for now but I'm sure
I'll see you again
I want to tell you my feelings someday
Until that time
For the first time
I learned the word called mom
I memorized the word called dad
I learned the word called wind
I memorized the word called water
I learned the word called friend
I memorized the word called dream
Around the time I memorized the word called love
I learned the shape of the world
For example, although I'll convey what I'm feeling now
What sort of words would be correct?
Only to know that simple answer,
I'll determinedly continue my wordplay
I learned the word called lie
I memorized the word called wound
I learned the word called sin
I memorized the word called retribution
Around the time I memorized the word called evil
I learned the darkness of the world
For example, when you abandoned me
What sort of words would apply?
In order to learn an answer I don't want to know
Let's continue my wordplay for some ways yet
Good morning, good day, thank you, farewell
I will be here no matter what
Teach me words as always
And I will change them into a song
What did you obtain in a delusion?
Only one song of truth
Lulila lulila, this singing voice
To who's side will it reach?
Obtaining a key called words
And opening the gates of the unknown
I carried in both hands the toy
I had requested, and thus obtained
And threw it out the window
Humans who are never satisfied
What do you wish for, what will you achieve?
If you're worn out, now simply
Sleep
Lulila lulila, can this lullaby
Heal your heart, I wonder?
Carrying a sin called desire
And right now still dreaming
Twelve songs that denote time
Scattered keywords
I peeked into Pandora's box
And continued to search for proof of my existence
In the end, I of the miniature garden
Wasn't anyone
Is the clockwork lullaby
If you don't turn me
I'll stop forever
The flower-like memories
And even the mud-like traumas
They continue to turn and melt
All of it inside of me
Oh ho ho ho ho
Come, kneel to me!
Once upon a time
Reigning at the top
Of a fiendish kingdom was
A noble girl of age 14
Luxurious and splendid furnishings
A servant whose face greatly resembled hers
A favorite horse named Josephine
Everything, everything was hers
If there wasn't enough money
Choke it from the ignorant masses
Those that would oppose me
Completely purge them
The flower of evil sweetly blooms
With brilliant color
The pitiful weeds around her
Indeed, they'll turn to nourishment and rot away
The tyrant princess was in love with
A blue man of across the sea
Though he fell in love at first sight
With a green woman in the neighboring country
The princess, mad with jealousy
One day summoned her cabinet minister
And said in a quiet voice
"Send to ruin the kingdom of green"
Many houses reduced to ashes
Many lives disappearing
The suffering people's lamentations
Don't reach the princess
"Oh, it's tea time"
With maddening color
Although it's a very lovely flower
Indeed, there are too many thorns to touch it
To overthrow the evil princess
At last the people rose up
Leading the disorderly mob was
A female swordsman in red armor
Their rage accumulated in conviction
Wrapped up the whole country
Soldiers tired from the long war
Weren't a threat
Finally they surrounded the palace
The retainers escaped
The adorable and lovely princess
At last was captured
"You insolent thug!"
With colors that seem sad
The paradise for her
Indeed will collapse, brittle and transient
There was a noble girl of age 14
Who reigned at the top
Of a fiendish kingdom
The time of her execution was 3 PM
A time when church bells would ring
That person who was called princess
What did they think, alone in jail?
Finally that time arrived
The bells signaling the end ring
Without taking notice of the crowd
She said
The flower of evil pitifully scatters
Afterwards, people will say
Indeed, she was certainly the Daughter of Evil
If only we could be reborn
You are the princess, I am a servant
Fate divided, miserable twins
I'll protect you, if it's for that
I will even become evil
We were born in high expectations
Blessed by the church bells
By the arbitrary circumstances of adults
Our futures were split into two
Even if all the world
Becomes your enemy
Because I will protect you
You should keep on smiling
While on an outing to the neighboring country
In town I happened upon that green haired girl
I fell in love at first sight
With that kind voice and smile
But if the princess
Asks me to erase that girl
I shall answer that
Why? These tears won't stop
Fate divided, maddened twins
"Today's treat is brioche"
You laugh, you innocently laugh
This country may end very soon
At the hands of its crazed people
If it's said this is our punishment
I shall take it upon myself to oppose it
"Look, I'll loan you my clothes"
"Wear them and escape immediately"
"It's alright, we're twins."
"I'm sure no one will know"
I am the princess, you are a fugitive
Fate divided, sorrowful twins
If it's said that you're evil
Then that same blood runs in me too
I had a very precious sibling
Keep smiling somewhere
You speak my favorite phrase
Let's play again then, okay?
At a small harbor on the outskirts of town
Is a girl standing alone
At this sea there's a
Secret tradition from long ago
"Put in a small bottle"
"Your wish written on parchment"
"If it's set adrift in the sea, one of these days"
"Your wish might bear fruit"
It floats away, a small glass bottle
A message with a wish put in
Beyond the horizon
It silently disappears
Although you always
Did everything for me
I was always nothing but selfish
And inconvenienced you
You who granted my wishes for me
Because you're already gone
So I will deliver my feelings
To this sea
It floats away, a small wish
With tears and a little regret
The realization of my sin was always
After everything was over
If only I had been human
Inside this room it's just you and me
Let's continue singing this song together
I don't have to know anything of the outside world
If that's what you wish
I called you "father"
And you called me "daughter"
Worrying about me who can't walk, you
Completely filled up the room with beautiful things for me
In a red glass
Is a blue spoon
A pair of two mirrors with yellow borders
A dark bedroom and the window's scenery
That's all of the world to me
You are always kind, but
You don't teach me of the outside world
The small objects of this room
They laugh at me
"You and us are one and the same"
Lulila lulila, I sing
So that the outside world can't hear
I shall sing for your sake alone
Because that's what I wish
From your mouth I heard a word called "war"
Why is the room burning?
From a burned out mansion they found
The remains of a solitary man, and
A scorched clockwork doll
Mother,
What kind of fortune does this path lead to?
Over there,
Will we be able to eat lots of our favorite snacks?
Father,
Beyond this point is God waiting for us?
Why
Do you look at us with such sad faces?
Inside the dark forest
We understood the whole truth
That if we continue in this way
We'll soon be unable to return
The two of us left all alone
Our names are Hansel and Gretel
By the small light of the great moon
We don't know the way home
We walk, a wandering walk
It doesn't mean we don't have a clue
A small glass bottle is lit up by the moon
The sparkling light illuminates the way
Nevertheless, we'll walk
Without knowing whether this is the correct path
Finally we found it, and we understand
This is the witch's house
Come, let's attack the evil witch
Cast her in the burning stove
When she's gone, surely we can become happy
Hey mother, praise me
I defeated the evil witch
Hey father, praise me
I defeated the witch's henchman too
At any rate
This is a really calming place, huh?
It feels as if though long ago,
We used to live here, doesn't it?
Come, let's go meet our "real" mother and father.
Where was here, I wonder?
Who was I, I wonder?
I unroll a colorless map
To the south, to the south
Where did she go off to, I wonder?
Who was "she", I wonder?
I'm searching for a person I don't know at all
To the north, to the north
At an intersection built at someone's whim
If we didn't notice, we would have passed through
"Good day" "Good day"
"Nice to meet you" "Nice to meet you"
"How are you?"
Highly similar but a little different, such a pair
That they met in this way could also be some kind of fate
Having stopped a bit, is having a chat
Something we can go do here as well? With the two of us
The town is already far over the horizon
The one I met was
While like "a mirrored image"
She's a different me
Same appearance, same ribbon
Even if we secretly switch places
People probably wouldn't find out, huh?
Together we laughed
In the south I was a student
In the north I ruined a country
Happy things, sad things
One by one we tell each other them
In the end, let's laugh
Highly similar but a little different, if such a world
Met in this way, would something change?
With our personalities we choose different paths
But that isn't a mistake either
The worlds just cross
The worlds just gone
It is simply foreordination
No reason for us
But we are here
So "nice to see you"
We're just alike
We're not the same
It is simply you and me
"It's time to go"
Before long it's time for farewells, huh?
It was fun. "Another me"
Bye bye, if we have the chance again some day
At this crossing...
When I woke, I was alone
In a room smeared black
Not able to see, not able to hear
I tremble alone in the dark
In the ceiling there's a big hole
Looking closely, there's a huge spring in there
From beyond that, there suddenly resounds
A ghastly, mysterious voice
"Sinful boy"
"From this point on you will never"
"Be brought from this room", it said
In that moment I recalled all of my memories
The many sins piled upon myself
Along with the reason I'm here, in the end I realized
That I can't return to back then anymore
When I came to, both my arms were clad in red manacles
That is surely the color of someone's spilled blood
As for both my ankles, they have blue colored chains
That is surely the color of someone's tears
"Lulila lulila", the song I came to hear
I wonder who is singing this lullaby...?
How much time has passed?
I asked of the unmoving spring
Only the singing voice
That I'm hearing out of nowhere heals me
One day I realized
The true meaning of that song
And I added on new words
To the lullaby
From a gap in the spring
A small light fell down
This is, surely
A message you sent me
The spring that began to turn recites quietly
"Your sins will never be forgiven"
But a word called water, a word called evil
We shall change those into a song
The red manacles fall off and address me
"After this you will be reborn"
The blue shackles fall off and talk to me
"Today is your new birthday"
Everything spins and dyes white
I'll go to see you very soon
"Come, eat without leaving anything."
In a corrupted mansion with a rotten stench hanging in the air
Today as well the last supper begins
With numerous foods that could make anyone's hair stand on end
Is the lone smile of a woman looking to eat
Her name is Banica Conchita
Formerly a master of this land's gourmet foods
To that end what she pursued
Was to extremes the most supreme evil food
Honor and praise
Our own great Conchita
This world's food
All of it exists for you
Completely devour everything in this world
There's still room to go in my stomach
This pale blue, shining, deadly poison
Is most suitable as a spice for the main dish
Chew it down to the bone marrow
If that's not enough, bite into the dishes too
The tip of my tongue running with supreme bliss
This dinner isn't over by a long shot
My fifteenth cook
Employed this year said to me:
"Before long might I be able to take a vacation?"
Good grief, you can't do anything with these people, huh?
Let's give thanks
For receiving traitors' just desserts
Today's menu is specially made
The pale blue shining hair
Is just right as an hors d'oeuvre for the salad
If that's not enough, you should get "seconds"
Just a second, Mr. Servant over there
What kind of taste do you have, I wonder?
Before she knew it the mansion was completely empty
And there was nothing inside,
There wasn't anyone anymore
Nevertheless she continued to desire
To extremes the most supreme evil food
She looked at her own right hand
And quietly smiled
"There's still something to eat isn't there?"
Conchita's last evil food
The ingredients were, yes, her very self
Now there's no longer anyone who knows the flavor
Of the body that had thoroughly mastered foods
In a dark DARK corner of the forest
I picked up red RED fruits
These are surely wonderful, WONDERFUL
Presents from God
If I carry them home will we be delighted, I wonder?
Maybe so happy we'll cry
The moon is very pretty today, isn't it?
Let's hurry, HURRY to return home
For on a dark night such as this
A SCARY bear comes out
At long last I've found them,
Finally I've found them
I certain don't want to do something
Like hand them over to anyone, to ANYONE
I run through a forest path where flowers bloom
While I'm carrying with me red fruits
If I return like this, he and I
Surely can become happy
Later on however, a bear that
Made a scary face chases me
Please, forgive me
Please overlook me
I knew that in truth, these fruits
Are that bear's treasures
I run, a wandering run
I won't hand over my happiness
The bear's form is illuminated by the moon
Its dark shadow draws closer to me
The correct path is already lost
But still I run, I only run
I cry, the bear was crying too
The two fruits were also crying
At last I finally arrived, at my beloved home
He was kindly smiling, but
He saw the fruit I held
And made a very sad face
"Listen, our children are already
Not in this world
Return these children
To their true mother's side"
Even if reality tore me apart someday
With its fangs and claws
Those warm, kind fruits
I wanted them at any cost
God, with my own hands
I committed an unforgivable sin
"If you do it now you can start over"
He said that, but
"That's impossible! Because I already..."
Lying down outside the house
Is the corpse of a lone woman
Nearby, full of milk, was a small glass bottle...
Made in order to create
With the same appearance, in order to be loved equally
I of the serial number "BMD2"
Awoke inside a garbage treatment plant
Again I've been thrown here alone
Defective goods aren't considered necessary
Escape from the basement of "C factory", the 43rd floor,
Is an impossible thing
"Toys meant to be loved don't need any individuality"
"A mass produced model is like a mass produced model"
Our existence disturbs that rule
To them, that was an unforgivable thing
Buried in scrap iron are screws, gears, and pride
If that's natural, why were we born?
Irregular who had gained an ego, our having met like this
That was the beginning of one miracle
That occurred in an ostentatious world...
I knew of the route going outside
A dilapidated exhaust port without a lock
Why then, although everyone should know of it
Has no one tried to move?
I knew of the outside world
There isn't anything good there at all
But you do your best, don't you?
I'll consider it, just a little
"Don't misunderstand, because this isn't really for you!"
"Mhm, I know, thank you very much!"
Come, our battle begins now
From this garbage processing plant to a new world
If we were born normally, could we have lived happily?
Our defective selves, can they really not be loved by anyone?
To ascertain that, now the two of us shall escape from here
The beginning of one adventure
Eventually you'll arrive at many meetings and farewells
Eventually you'll learn about many things
What is normal? Is that the right thing?
But now you should just intently continue running
The sound of the clocktower's gears
That is the proof she's alive
So that this second hand doesn't stop
Watching over it is "my" role
The former master, a personification of greed
Why couldn't he notice sooner
That his own sin would ruin himself
One of these days?
The ugly burn marks that remain
On half of her body even now
Etch those two's memories
Today again there are lost
Pitiful visitors who don't know anything
Before long they'll probably be delivered
Into the "Master of the Graveyard"'s stomach
That "girl" pretending to be the lead role
As usual is absorbing herself in selfishness
While the loneliness of having lost her "counterpart"
Shows a little on her face
Just before his death a solitary man created
That small theater deep in the forest
In that time when it was left behind, it began to ring out
The clockwork lullaby
"Bloodstained scissors", "Violet katana"
The days we wait for those who have yet to wake
When all the songs have been recited
It appears Utopia will complete
The clock hand stopping
Means the end of herself
The time left in the rusted and chipped gears
Isn't long
The one acting as curator is the one he loved most
"The Clockwork Doll"
Resolving myself
I gently placed my hand
Into my own left breast and reached in deeply...
Lalulilala lalulilala
My spring resounds with the gears of the clocktower
And the story begins anew
So that the clock hands don't stop
Continuing to turn is my role
In the afternoon, heading back from shopping
On the short way back home
All you said was just
"Yep" and "that's true"
Every day it's become common
For us to be together
With the warmth of your hand in mine
I thought, I guess this is nice
Right now I don't have any complaints
Towards you of few words either, but
So that I won't forget these lovely feelings
I have some words I want to hear
I don't need anything else
I don't need money either
I think I'd like to go on dates every now and then
I don't need it 100 times
I'm fine with just once
I want you to put it in words
"I want you to say you love me"
"Let's talk about something"
It's true there are times when all I say are complaints
And there are times when
I can't stand the quiet when we're alone together
In the end, several days go by
And as the times we've shared pile up
I've learned we can understand each other
Even without words
We were almost home
Those few words you said
After you had suddenly stopped in place
I'll remember my whole life
As long as I'm with you
Forgive me a little that I'm bad at cooking
I don't need words either
That's what I thought,
But I'm still so happy
"You said you love me"
Come, let's begin tailoring
There was a young woman who was the owner
Of a tailor shop in the corner of Enbizaka
Good-natured, with definite skill,
She was a popular girl in the neighborhood
What distressed such a woman
Was her loved one's infidelity
"While he has someone such as me,"
"He never returns home"
But I have to keep at my work
I tightly grip my scissors in one hand
Sewing scissors inherited from my mother,
The more you sharpen, the better they cut
Today the town is like always
Indeed, it's calm and peaceful as usual
On the main street I chanced upon him
Who the heck is the woman next to him?
In a red kimono that suits her well,
He's affectionate with that lovely woman
Unable to bear walking to that sight,
I immediately left that place
While my cheeks are wet with tears,
I work hard to resew a kimono
The town has an uneasy air for some reason,
It seems some scandal has occurred
In front of the bridge I chanced upon him
With a depressed air about him
He's nestled against a woman with beautiful hair
That green obi suits her very well
Ahh, that's the kind of girl you prefer?
While clearing my red eyes,
I work hard to mend an obi
The town has suddenly begun to make a fuss
It seems there was another scandal
At the hairpin store I chanced upon him
He was buying an ornate yellow hairpin
For a very young girl
What the heck do you think you're doing?
You're really indiscriminate, aren't you?
Were the scissors this color before, I wonder?
I work hard today as well
At last I've hit a stopping point in my work
If you won't come to meet me
I'll go from here to meet you
The red kimono, the green obi
The yellow hairpin, I put it in my hair
I've become the kind of woman you prefer~
How is it? Aren't I beautiful?
Today the whole town is in an uproar
This time a man has been killed
With this, it seems a whole family of four
Has been killed by someone
At any rate, he was a cruel man
"Nice to meet you, good day" and such
Isn't that like a stranger?
Sewing scissors stained red,
"I'm sorry for being alive"
Before I knew it that was my catchphrase
Mine was a dull life of saying nothing but complaints
Everyone in my village has beautiful green hair
I'm left out, with white hair different from theirs
A millennium tree secretly towers
Over the scenery deep in the forest
When alone here, I made a wish to god
To carry on living in isolation, that's very lonely
Anyone would be fine
I want someone to become my friend
I met her, near the millennium tree
She had collapsed and I saved her
That was the beginning
Before I knew it the two of us
Were getting along well
But just about everything
Between me and her was different
She had green hair more beautiful
Than anyone in the village
With her kind voice and smile,
She was loved by everyone
Why are you being so kind
To someone like me?
Do you intend on pitying
A woman who's inferior to you?
Embracing the abject me
She whispered
"You are more wonderful than anyone else"
Tears spilled out
Even if all the people in the world
Scorned and mocked me
There's someone who needs me
With only that, I was happy
The two of us rushed from the village,
And started living in town
It's an unfamiliar life,
But if we're together it's alright
The servants of a rich merchant's wife
That was the work we chose for a living
One day on the grounds we happened upon
A handsome, blue haired man
The meeting between he and her derailed everything
He was the ruler of a country across the ocean,
And, loving her deeply,
He refused the marriage proposal of
A princess in the neighboring country
The country was engulfed in the horrors of war
The decree the princess made:
"All of the green haired women,"
"Kill them"
Everyone, everyone was lost forever
Except the white haired me
I should have died in her place
Why, why?
I began my new livelihood in a port city's church
I heard from a rumor on the wind
That in the revolution, the princess died
I met her, near the church
In the night confessional when no one was around
By chance I heard her confession
Ah, what does this mean?
She is certainly the Daughter of Evil
She is standing alone
From behind I draw near
From my breast pocket I took out
A knife, pointed it at the princess' back
And raised it high
I have an apology I must make to you
In the end I didn't remove your enemy
That girl is the old me, a very very solitary person
To carry on living by yourself, that's very lonely
She who could do nothing
Became a little more skillful in her cooking
Today's treat, brioche
Is very deliciously baked
That moment at that beach
For an instant I saw an illusion
Who in the world
Was that boy, I wonder?
One day I fell in love
With a small, speckled frog
We met at a deep blue colored spring
Let's go together to my castle
Can we begin from being friends?
Let's devour a delicious dinner together
On this beautiful starry night
While gazing at the sky let's talk about our love
Those big eyes, those wet lips
I just love everything about you
From now on, let's always snuggle together
And spend time together
If you whisper ribbit ribbit to me
With that lovely, broken voice
Our world will become rose colored
This is my and your love romance
One day you disappeared
I searched but you weren't anywhere
I cry your name in desperation
While dragging along my long body
I was raspily bawling
Can I never seen you again anymore?
Against my instincts
I had been looking forward to your growing up
But those big eyes, those wet lips
If the time came, I loved you to the point of
Wanting to eat you
In a very sad state
I swallowed all of today's dinner whole
Come to think of it,
I guess it does resemble you a little
Before long shall we go out? To that spring
You, wriggling at the bottom of the flask
Are now the sacrifice for the ceremony that will begin after this
The solids inside liquids silently dissolve
The more samples the better
Before disappearing, that person said
"I won't return here again
Continue with your experiments"
On the night of the full moon the experiment begins
The scent of reagent drives my heart mad
An inspection of hypothesis, a calculation of theory
I destroy something, and I create something
Supposing I joined together two so that they became one
That doesn't mean it'll come to have twice the value
There is just one thing that I truly want to obtain
In order to create it, the experiments will continue
Those words I memorized in the beginning
I haven't forgotten now
So next it's my turn to teach a new song
Even on the night of a new moon, the experiment won't end
This white doctor's gown gradually stains red
Inspection of subjects, denial of common sense
I destroy something, and I destroy again
Just like that person made me
This time I will create that person
Someday let's begin that game again
Because I'll be here no matter what, right?
La la la la la la la lalala
La la la la la la la lululu
If only we could start over
Santa gave to me
A revolver with live rounds
I aim at you standing before my eyes
Goodbye, the one I love
If I could do it over
I'd want to go see the summer fireworks festival again
Just the two of us
Sorry, 'cause I know
That such a thing is already impossible
Because from the beginning, everything between us
Was just too different
Beneath the cherry blossom tree
You met the "evil" me
You were on the side of "justice"
Even so, I came to like you
This isn't my first time shooting someone
But this is the first time I'll shoot while crying isn't it?
Please, because it's all my fault
Don't make such a kind face
In spring we met and fell in love
In summer we made a lot of memories
On an autumn night we became one
In winter we marked the end of everything
The hammer raises, my finger on the trigger
My index finger trembles slightly
In the end I said "Sorry"
In the end, you...
Don't worry, because I'm sure I'll be able to see you soon
Let's always be together
That's something we always said, huh?
Abandoned! Cup! Beg! Crawl! Lose! Back! Lung! Ash!
Honor and praise our own master
The forest's graveyard is her feeding grounds
In the corrupted graveyard with a rotten stench hanging in the air
Our master's name is the Evil Food Eater
Honor and praise the great master
In a small theatre in the middle of the graveyard
She was reborn as the ruler of the dead
Her name is the Evil Food Eater
Completely devour it all!
Everything in that world
An eternally unending dinner
Come, let's begin
Preparation of the
Lost, pitiful intruders
"Ohohoho!"
"Welcome to Evil's Forest."
"First, would you like to be grilled?"
"Would you like to be boiled?"
"Or... Fufufu."
"Oh well, be at your leisure."
"In the end, down to your bones,"
"Until there's nothing left, I. SHALL. EAT."
An insatiable deadly sin, an end that can't be seen
The forest's graveyard is the entrance to madness
Enemies consumed by craving will be destroyed
She's the chosen woman, the Evil Food Eater
The gardener's ambitions are too an amusement
Right now we'll give ourselves over to her
But someday she, too, will be in the stomach
Of the black hearted witch, the Evil Food Eater
Chew it all up!
All of the malice
An eternally unending nightmare
Dark red blood
Is being poured in
The cracked glass
Tirelessly chew it up!
Until the day of the ending
That's bound to come one day,
Let's continue to party
Peter Pan arrived at my side
Stuck to her desk,
She scribbled down her delusions in a letter
Next to that she said,
How can people seem to fly through the sky?
The moon was waned enough to look funny
Facing there, I jumped out the window
Because I believed that I could soar through the sky
Even without wings, I wasn't afraid
With both hands spread I took in the wind
Where will I go? Higher, higher
People are like trash
What I saw from way too high up in the sky
Was a RED LIGHT
Going towards somewhere with incredible speed
Along with the troubles of my heart I'd been carrying,
Everything was as small as it was sad
As I was then, I didn't realize
Everyone was laughing somewhere
Peter Pan isn't anywhere, I'm alone
In my room with the lights off
A flower was blooming on the desk
I turned to people wearing black clothes
And waved my hand; see ya, bye-bye!
Papa, Mama, please, don't you cry too
At a place with nothing there
I suddenly tripped and burst into tears
It's alright, this is surely
A prank of the bad twilight
We should return soon
Before it gets dark
At the other end of the sea's horizon
The demon sweetly sneered
"I'll put you in
My black stomach, and then let's play"
Before we're eaten
The small box
We had hidden in the sandy beach
It's wrapped in the night's darkness
It will never be found again
Let's share the sunset
One half each
I'll be the day
I'll be the night
If we join hands, we get an orange sky
The third ring of the bell is
A signal that the demon is awakening
Making a greedy face
It fixes a glance this way
Because I won't give up my snack!
With its stomach empty, the demon
Made a very sad looking face
"Even if I swallowed down the whole world"
"My stomach won't get full"
I pity it, so I'll share my snack
"Thank you, dear prince"
"In thanks, I shall covertly"
"Tell you a small secret"
"Of this sea"
Later I'll tell you too
The wonderful secret of this sea
Come, shall we dance?
Today again, a lovely woman
Arrives at my side
You, expressing a smile,
Will become my new wife
This power I obtained by a contract
With a forbidden demon
All of the women who see me
Fall into a charm
The man who obtained the power to charm women,
Bringing in women who suit him one by one
To the cellar of the the mansion where he lives alone,
Built up a harem
The flavor of the libido with hidden poison
The pleasure of the thrusted blade
Blood and sweat come together and mix
Before long changing to drops of purple
When the clothes come off and we embrace,
We can never again return to reality
The old portraits I burned,
My abandoned past self
I want to forget that face
That everyone scornfully laughed at
I embrace and kiss
An adorable woman next to me
Yes, she was a former childhood friend
Who made fun of me
Since one day the women in this country
Before they knew it went to be lost in lust one by one
Separating some people's wives and some people's daughters,
They were at a loss
The color of libido stained in darkness,
Unrestrained and infinite lust
The illusions swallow down everything,
Soon I won't be human
In defiance of god I commit depravity,
This is the night of insanity I wished for
Come to my chest;
Let's dance in my harem
I held you who drew close to me;
In that instant where I smiled
With a sudden sharp pain,
My chest is stained in blood
A young man who was searching for his vanished love
Determined she was; the mansion where the demon lives
As a woman, the young man drew closer to him
And thrust into the demon a dagger from his breast pocket
Stuck by a dagger with hidden poison
I collapsed then and there
Blood and sweat come together and mix,
before long they'll change to drops of purple
My arts dissolved, all the women came to their senses
and rushed from the mansion
Looking at me for just a moment,
the last to leave from the mansion was
That childhood friend; wait!
I haven't yet told you I love you
In the world buried in sand
We've been searching for the blue bird
Even though it's painful, if I'm with you
Surely it can be overcome
In this world with civilization destroyed
Before us siblings an old woman appeared with a favor
"In order to save the world, I want you to"
"Locate the blue bird"
That's the desert BLUE BIRD
Suddenly we were entrusted with the fate of the world
Packing our hopes in the car
Our journey began
Blue bird, that's a legend
A miracle that could grant every wish
After a long journey, we discovered
The blue bird's location
An enormous, crumbled building
There were people who feared that it shouldn't be walked in
For the sake of the hesitant me, you
Ran in alone
If something happened, my timid little sister
Would always tremble at my back
Packing courage into your heart
You enter the building
You discovered it, the bluebird
In your arms, with your eyes shut,
You won't be waking up again
A facility polluted with "nuclear radiation"
What I had lost was too much
I wished to the blue bird
Your eyes open once again
The blue bird vanished somewhere
I walked with you beyond then
We finally reached the far end of the world
There was a blue and vast...
...Ocean
Everything will begin from here
We'll rebuild the world with our own hands
DESERT BLUE BIRD
It's a miracle
Welcome to this happy country,
I'll undo the chains that bind you hand and foot
A ferris wheel, haunted house,
And just for tonight, yes, a slave for you
If you're worn from playing, come here,
Inside a cold cradle
Madam Merry-Go-'Round
Queen of the amusement park
A shackled host
A transient utopia seen
From on top of the wooden horse
Even if the world is destroyed
I will be here
You should go around now,
And completely forget everything
If you want your wish granted,
Get in line, wait your turn
The shining shadow parade,
Their eyes on the end, will keep on through thick and thin
These midnight games;
The one desiring them
Isn't me, it's you
A beauty resembling someone
Those forgotten memories
A genial warmth
She embraced with white hands
Even if you're in love
It's a dream bound to one night
A vow exchanged between the two
That wasn't kept that day
Even if you can't go back home,
Don't blame me, okay?
Is that the song of birds that I can hear?
No, that is the cry of the forest
Is that the light of the moon that's shining?
No, that's the burning fire
The person we used to call "mother"
Turns to ashes inside the stove
"The Original Sin" that remained afterwards
We divided into seven with our own hands
"Lust", is the flower
"Gluttony", is the seed
"Pride", is the stone
"Envy", is the spring
"Sloth", is the wind
"Greed", is the dirt
And,
"Wrath", is the forest
Fly away, seven sins
The impurity born from our false mother
Let the world turn and turn
This evil, grave sin
Purify it
By the hands of the forbidden fruit
The seven sins were released into the world
The tree of Held, who protects the forest,
Requests his friend to collect them all
"If it turns into a way to kill time that's no problem"
"'Cause my time is infinite anyhow"
The sorceress sneers
The eternity she was granted
At the end of having lost the one she loved
And destroyed what was precious
To her was nothing but emptiness
The sorceress who obtained everything
And then lost it
What does she wish for?
What does she seek?
To the end of time...
Born and raised from a lone woman
The story of such a sin cut into seven
The capricious whim of a witch who transcends time
This Chrono Story that begins from the forest
Lulila
"Come, it's time for the trial."
A disgraced administration of justice
With charges decided by the defendant's wealth
As the master of the court
I desire money more than justice
Even if you're a scoundrel
If you pay money I'll save you
Money is the best lawyer in Hell
Appearance and age, race and gender
All of it's irrelevant
The most important thing is if you can pay money
That's all there is to it
Your life depends on me
If you want help, show me the money
Yes, your sins are my consideration alone
Judgement of corruption
If you want rescue from a swamp of false charges
Hand over more money
For the sake of my disabled daughter, too
I need money
If I collect the seven vessels of grave sin
My wish will come true
Today too in the unfolding courtroom of doubt
The wicked laugh, the innocent cry
If it's to grant my own dearest wish
I will continue to swing this unjust mallet
A vicious general is a mass murderer
A capital crime charge is natural
I was handed a bribe, and I
Declare the defendent innocent
In the resulting rage, a civil war began
The general was killed
His miserable corpse is exposed on the field
The force of the anger comes to face me
And my house blazes
My beloved "daughter"
If we two are together, I have nothing to fear
From the burned down mansion, they'll probably find
The remains of a solitary "parent and child"...
This place where I was alone when I opened my eyes
Is the gate of the Hellish Yard
Heaven or hell, that is decided by
The Master of the Hellish Yard
I smile at the Master of the Hellish Yard
And softly whisper
"I will never hand over my fortune to the likes of you"
I jumped through the door and my body
Falls right down to the bottom of hell
Yes, sins are my consideration alone
No matter who it is, I won't approve
Anyone judging this sin of mine
Yes, one day I will again gather in my hands
The fragments of deadly sin
In that moment, hell may turn into
Me and my daughter's utopia...
The song that resounds with lulila, lulila
Is a sorrowful song, painting time
The moon that shines in the sky is beautiful
From the sword blooms a beautiful flower
From the seed blooms a beautiful glass
On the night of a full moon, it continued to be refined
And the stone became four mirrors
They brightly sparkle, along with a small bottle
The blades that become a pair are dipped in the spring
The color of the spring goes the color of blood
The color of the blood of those who aimed for it
The doll moves by the invisible wind
The spoon ladles invisible soil
All were assembled then
In the end they return, they return to the forest
Along with anger, to where it overflows
Now advance on! A shadow parade
Wearing matching red shoes
Madly dancing as though broken
Aim for the end, through thick and thin
The morning road is full of dangers
A bad thief obstructs our path
Before he steals, steal from him
In the name of our great righteousness
If we keep on walking, our stomachs will diminish too
A bad thief has a home
Steal his amassed feast
Carrying a moon-shaped crest of arms on our backs,
Our red footsteps resound
Yearning for people in the pattern of the sunset
A bad thief has a family
Console both the heart and body
The rain drizzles on the melancholy night
A bad thief was laughing
Slaughter him, we're jealous
Praise us, this unending march
Our iron footsteps resound
The suddenly echoed sound of a whistle
Signaled the end of our journey
Time passed, and one day
From the dark room we went out into the light
So once again the journey begins
The people down the road see us
And laugh, and cry
Our steps are hot as though burning
These red shoes are different than the usual
When we realized the true meaning of that
The shadow parade burned out
You said it was "punishment"
A music box with golden springs that warped
The unplaying melody is a song of love
A music box that disappeared in the shadow of history
A jeweled box that won't be opened
The music boxes he made played with a sound that was
More beautiful than anyone else's
The people, filled with a sense of respect for him,
Called him "Clockworker"
A beloved fiancee and a precious younger sister
"I am a lucky man", he thanked god
For their sakes he would create it, filled with love
An extraordinary, peerless music box
In the music box he packed his wish
For their future then on to have great happiness
Now the music box won't play anymore
In this country, whoever possesses the strongest magical talent
Will become ruler, and obtain everything
The ones selected as candidates for new leader were
The fiancée and younger sister
The gears began to go mad,
Those two who came together in hatred
Could have lived together in harmony,
If there was no such thing as magic
It was the worst conclusion; what he saw
Was the music box he built stained in blood
The fallen woman and the wailing woman
Both were loved, loved and yet
A place that used to have a country is now a ruin
An old man who's lost his sanity is making something
Travelers enquired as to what he's making
The old man replies that it's a music box
But it was a dirty black box
That just looks like simple trash
"Come, sleep..."
Sleep with this gift, you'll sleep well with this gift
Yes I am the sleep princess, for the sake of your happiness...
It was a marriage decided by the result of politics
Nevertheless I loved you
You're an incompetent playboy wallowing in desire
But I loved you from before
You're only after the wealth of a doctor's daughter
Aside from that I'm happy, nonetheless
You can also forget our promise when we were children
If I can be by your side
For you who is troubled by anxious feelings
I have a very good medicine
You can have pleasant dreams, so your worn body can be healed
It's a present from me
Everyone carries troubles
My dad, my mom, and the people of this town
For the sake of everyone who can't sleep at night
I'll make this gift, a sleeping medicine
Unpleasant reality, unrequited feelings
If inside a dream, these things can be forgotten
Like a baby inside their crib
With your eyes closed, abandon yourself
Everyone swallowed my gift
And became happy, each and every one
As the only one who can't sleep, I instead
Obtained freedom and riches
Yes I am the sleep princess, a woman who sought hope
In those days where I was only used like a decorative doll
I was already broken long ago, I wanted to destroy everything
It's a very efficacious medicine,
Efficacious up to being able to sleep forever
With this, finally I too will be able to sleep,
From the Sleep Princess to Sleeping Princess...
"Come, my prince, kiss me in that forest."
If only I wasn't reborn
At 2 AM in a dark town,
Who will be the victim tonight?
Punishing bad children,
That's Pierrot's job
From Ms. Santa he learned
That the world is full of mistakes
Fifth Clown will
Dance in the dark night today too
The boy who played fool
With a painted white face
Thrusts a silver knife
In a fat pig
Tonight the chaotic Pie-Pierrot
In a circus of night without an audience
Plays on a flute for that moon,
And the black goes to red
Today too, madly dancing Pie-Pierrot's
Devilish cage has already been opened
The beast of prey that jumped through hoops of fire
Will make a wandering walk through town
With kind and dark eyes
Seventh Magician
Sweetly tempted him
To escape from here
He explained to Ms. Santa
That there's a traitor
The next day the Magician's
Whereabouts became unknown.
Gently stroking
Pierrot's head,
Ms. Santa's hands,
They were like...
Today is work too, Pie-Pierrot,
Waited for prey in a shadowy back alley
Suddenly there's a plosive sound,
His chest really hurts, Pie-Pierrot
Doesn't want to die! He doesn't want to die!
Silently standing before his eyes is
Eighth, Sniper
Very tiredly closed his eyes
Smiling inside the dream are
His real mother and father
He won't be dancing anymore, Pie-Pierrot,
"That's why I told you to escape."
Yes, sneering so, quietly, was
Seventh, Magician...
Surpass the forest, be chased from the graveyard
You'll probably make it to an old theater
In that place you'll be judged
You'll likely get a sin in this final trial
From the turning gear in the clocktower
The doll inherited her father's dying wish
Yes, I am the new Master of the Court
Now the gates of the Hellish Yard will be opened
Explain to me, my father
This is the correct choice isn't it?
Without having a heart, I don't understand
Should I see all of them off to hell?
Without having life, I don't understand
The gardener murmurs that in just a little while from now
The song that can't be recited's end is also close
If it's him or Ma that's correct
Without knowing that, I am striking this mallet
Dwelling in my inhuman womb,
Irregular makes my body tremble
Dear child, your role is after this, so
Sleep now with this lullaby
This is the correct fate isn't it?
Utopia will be made with this, won't it?
Help me, my father
The girl who always complained
Her white hair different from the people of the village
She knelt by the millennium tree deep in the forest
And made a wish, "I want a friend"
I wanted to grant her wish
But I can't do it with this body
At such a time, the
Whimsical sorceress who had appeared
Reincarnated the spirit me into a human
I don't yet know
Anything of the world outside the forest
So I don't understand
Why is she crying?
It's peaceful and boring
Although I'd expect that to be a wonderful thing
But I don't understand
Why are you crying?
Between our dreams, our races, and our values
The two of us who differ so have now met
Let this millennium vow resound to the end of the earth
A wiegenlied fastened to a fate of ruin
I'm different from you, but I'm drawn to you
I'll protect you, so stay by my side
My spirit self changes into the human me
If I have this body
I might be able to understand you
A life in a new city
Makes my heart tremble
Wherever kind of place we are
If the two of us are together, it's alright
The delight of living as a human
Little by little I was beginning to understand
Let this millennium vow resound across the sky
As the two of us change, it might be lonesome, but
If I can see your smile, it'll be okay
At an evening dinner party
I met the ruler of a country over the sea
This fate of ruin
Began to stir from there
Loving me, he rejects the marriage proposal
Of a neighboring country's princess
The blaze of her anger wraps the country in war
The two of us become separated
And now, I understand my feelings towards you
Let this millennium vow resound to your side
Even if I can't return to being a spirit
I won't be swaying from this decision I've made anymore
"I am in love with you"
Scorned and mocked you
You should always be smiling
If you can survive to safety
And if the day comes we can meet again
Let's live in harmony together in the forest
Because I'll be waiting here no matter what
The dark bottom of the well
The moon that's beautiful in the night sky
The knife stuck deep in my chest
My golden haired assassin departs somewhere
The cruel truth is in darkness
Transparent white hair, clumsy smile
Somehow, somehow live on, keep alive
If only I could see you
I had things I wanted to convey to you
If only I could be reborn
If I could be reborn...
An empty defendant's seat,
A visitor's gallery with nothing but junk
Come, let's begin this farce called a trial
Only one of the vessels
That we're seeking out by orders of god remains
If it's the case you know its whereabouts
Make your testimony, "Sorceress of Time"
Transcending time, changing forms, changing masters
It's already making its debut on stage
Even so, not knowing the whereabouts myself right now,
I fear it's likely that it's in her hands
Search, search, search for that jerk
Left, right, or down
She who holds all the keys
Search for "The Master of the Hellish Yard"
How long is this farce going to continue?
There is nothing after that
Soul of Adam who fell in the trap
There's nothing you can accomplish anymore
Swinging scales
A disordered scenario
Vessels sullied in sin
Each playing their song their own way
A discordant capriccio
The story has already let go of
The hands of demons and gods and walks alone
If they were in this place
They would probably make this lament:
What was truly terrifying
Was the desire of humanity
Let's sort what few facts we have,
Lowly man descended from a demon
I'll give you permission, so tell us
Of the time you came to this forest
There is an unpleasant curse dwelling in my body
Seeking my original ancestor's sword that has become
necessary to solve this, I arrived at this forest alone
Kill him, eat him, if we can't, arrest him
This insolent jackass who entered the forest
Judge, judge, at any rate judge him
Trial! Sentence! Death!
When I resolved myself after I was arrested
The fickle girl extended her hand
I wanted a charge right for doing chores
And so I became "The Gardener"
"Sorceress of Time" "Cursed Gardener"
Substitutes for the unawakened vessels
Each keeping their goals close to the chest
Unsettling invaders
"The Director Doll", "Master of the Graveyard"
"Gear", "The Waiter" "Master of the Hellish Yard"
When the end of everything arrives
Who will be laughing, I wonder?
Lulila lulila lulilulila
The resounding beat of Irregular
Friendship, trauma, justice, illusion
Hope, destruction, dreams, greed, love, death
All of it continues to melt and turn
Just before the solitary man's death
He constructed a theater
Will the utopia he wished for
Be completed?
Come, let's see with our own eyes
This farce called life
Abandoned by my parents when I was small
I was raised in an orphanage that could see the ocean
The one who raised me was
An old nun
She was very kind
And was always happily smiling
Although it was a poor life, but
All of us were happy
Eventually she fell to illness
The day she'd be summoned to heaven drew near
At her bedside
We said to her:
You've raised us up until now
We want to repay you for that
Now matter how absurd, it doesn't matter
Isn't there something you wish for?
She sweetly smiled
Like this, she came to respond:
I am always waiting
Waiting for a reply to my letter
I sent it one day when I was young
A letter that I don't know whether it arrived or not
If my wish comes true
If my sins are forgiven
I want a reply to that letter
I will wait for it
She laughs, It's a wish that can't be granted
Please forget it
The letter she sent
Who did she send it to?
We all divide our work up
And searched all over the country
And we found an old painter
Who knew her past
The old man tells the truth
She once killed people
Many people became unhappy
Many people shed tears
The recipient of the letter
Is someone no longer in this world
The reply won't come
Even so she'll wait, won't she?
Even after her body has rotten away
Surely she will wait
Until the reply comes
Her lifetime is drawing to a close
I press inside her hand
One sheet of parchment
That was a fake reply to the letter
That I wrote yesterday
She gave it a glancing look
And finally said "Thank you"
The sorrowful wish fades away
She had that same smile as always
Our realization of her sin was always
After everything ended
There was a woman called "The Flower of the Plateau"
A lovely flower vendor, she was adored by everyone
Her peacefully comforting smile was surely an angel's
There wasn't anyone in this town who knew
That she used to be a harlot
When a young lord fell in love with her at first sight
Everyone rejoiced and blessed her
And wished the two many years of happiness
The day before the engagement, a man appeared in the town
An ugly, vulgar brute who leeched off women
Someone who knew the secret, someone who knew her past
A flower absolutely must be pure
Three years passed, and a boy appeared in the town
Who sought his mother's love, even if that person
Was a dumb whore who cast him aside at birth herself
Isn't it good for the "Flower of the Plateau" to be happy?
She must not pay attention, she has no need to pay attention
To the two dead leaves and such buried at the bottom of the well
There isn't anyone in this town who knows that she used to be a harlot
There isn't anyone in this town who knows
That she used to be a harlot but me...
Smiling and sitting in a chair at the top of the clock tower,
Are you a demon, or are you my mother...?
The moving second hand sways
A normal spirit
Above the clock tower is
Justice or poison?
Each time I advance up the spiral staircase
A handbeat reverberates
Time and conflict, they strongly etch onto my heart
Hands that wallowed in greed and were sullied in sin
Who is the companion who should wield
The sword in the place of atonement?
A portrait of a girl
That my hands drew that day
That faint memory was
The beginning of madness
With seven nightmares,
An abnormal evil that was
Brought forth by a lone woman destroyed everything
But because the correct way
Still hasn't vanished
A dramatic Story "of Evil"
Is now drawing to a close
I won't hesitate anymore, even if this is an unavoidable fight
Even if it comes to turning my sword on you
Smiling and sitting in a chair at the top of the clocktower,
Someone, someone tell me
What in the world is "evil"?
I have just one hope; my heart is so empty
That I've grown sick of despair
There isn't much I can do, but
I tightly grasp my hands
And am always praying
For an end to this falling rain
Someone's laughing voice resounds louder than the long hand's sound
Now there's only madmen in the Handbeat Clocktower
Someday time will pass, if the day we can laugh at this suffering comes
With my own hands I will write the true story
Rotting and sitting in a chair at the top of the clocktower,
Are you a demon, or a person who was my mother...?
The white brick was an antique store
With left behind memories
In the corner of the shelf a mirror slept
It was someone's memory
The black mourning dress was an orphan
A girl with nowhere to go
On her search for a bed today
She meets that boy
Inside the display window
Is a small hand mirror
The girl fell in love
With the boy reflected only there
From that day on everything changed
Every day she went to meet him
He was always smiling
With that she was happy
The red uniform was an old gentleman
The owner of this worn-out shop
Without showing even a bit of a displeased face
He was watching over the girl
The yellow hair is the girl who's in love
She wants that hand mirror
But the amount of money written on the price tag
She can't match it
"Girl, if your eyes"
"Along with your heart"
"Remain pure, someday"
"I'll be with you"
The one who could hear that voice
Was surely just the girl before his eyes
He was smiling again today
When the girl had finally become an adult
She hadn't obtained the mirror
I couldn't remain pure
I'm completely corrupted
An unwanted life, an unwanted marriage
Eventually she gave birth to one son
I ran through a forest path where flowers scatter
A pair of red fruits
Held to my breast, I run through the night a fugitive
Not knowing my father, and not knowing my mother, I had grown up all alone
When I was 20, the one I loved was a culprit of murder
If you're attracted to evil
You'll find yourself tainted too
And the people called me "Witch"
I ran through an evil path where flowers bloom
A criminal who was splattered with red, fresh blood
And fled to a corrupted love
"My children aren't anywhere" cried a bloodstained, wailing woman
Looking down on that, I was suddenly wreathed in chains
My sins will one day be judged, the prison is inhuman and dark
A scientist who resembles him, stood in front of my execution chair
I, who wants to leave from here
The scientist, who wants a subject
Now, our two interests overlapped
I ran through a cold stone path
Taking off my white prisoner clothes
The destination I face is a research lab
The embedded divine seed pulsated inside of me
The two adorable twins I had birthed, experimental subjects without a father
I remember, I remember
That I was a ghoul child
Once manufactured inside a beaker
In this same way
My own children connected by the beaker
I know it's selfish
I won't let these children become their toys!
It was a life of only running away
The love I was not granted
Even a fragment of
I want to give to my children at least
Two babies that I love
Held to my breast, I run through the night; a fugitive
In a neighboring country, we live hidden
We had to stay out of the public eye
In moonlit nights we go out
The children and I
In our favorite, the forest of Held
It should have become a fun walk, but
In the mere moment I had taken my eyes off them,
"My children aren't anywhere!"
This is the story of the beginning
From where shall I tell?
My name is Eve Zvezda
The best witch in this country
The name of the man I love is Adam
A very superior scientist
He gave me a kiss and told me
"After this you will become the mother of gods, 'Mem Aleph'"
The dark legacy "sin"
Eventually it will destroy the country
The great prophet informed as much
The means to prevent that is reincarnation of the two dragon gods
We shall let the "Twins of God" be birthed
The project begins, search for the candidates for mother
They'll search for the woman who surpassed all in magical talent
The person elected "Ma", yes,
Will be this country's new queen
I don't know why I was selected
He embraced me with an "It's alright"
When everything's over with, let's have a marriage ceremony
In our favorite, Held's forest.
The divine seed is embedded in the cradle
I wait for the time they will be born, the "Twins of God".
From where should I tell?
My name is Adam Moonlit
The best scientist in this country
I have regretful news. The project was a failure
The twins were born already dead
With that, all my dreams and ambitions disappeared
To me project "Ma" is a heaven-sent chance
I will use it and control this country
The senate and Seth took my mother from me
Now it's time to punish them
The project begins, the candidate is a witch of Nemu village
We were acquainted and in temptation I made her my own lover
It was a simple thing with the "brainwashing drug"
I shouldn't have had any doubts, but
My beloved Eve, I've broken you, I'm sorry
My miscalculations were that the twins died
And that you, who I was with just to use,
I truly came to love, completely.
Come, let's get married in that forest
"I love you!" "I love you~"
The night the stars were broken, the moon and star vanished from the south sky
From where should I tell, hm?
My name is Seth Twiright
"Cain" and "Abel" were a failure
"Adam" and "Eve" disappeared
I must search for
The next "Mem Aleph"
For the sake of having my ambitions granted
The one who pressed the switch,
it wasn't me
This morning,
my kind father who I loved a whole lot
Turned into a pulpy mass of blood and meat pieces
The way Papa worked at the factory,
Watching that was so fun that
About every day I would come to visit him
Because the red switch
Is very dangerous
I obeyed the order
That I mustn't push it
It was another me
I should try to be a good girl; though I decided to that extent
Why do you do things your own way?
Hey Doctor,
Papa's death was really my alter ego's fault
Didn't the doctor say
That if I swallowed
The blue and white pill she gave me,
The switch wouldn't come on?
Before I knew it, the switch of changing places
Had been pressed
Ever since I was born, a girl who wanted to kill
Had taken root inside of me
It was another girl, so
It's not my fault
So don't inject me with that needle
I hate that needle!
The children of god aren't born
The children of god aren't found
While someone must become "mother"
While the children of god must be born
The maidens gathered in the temple
Four girls with different birthplaces and backgrounds
Only one can become "mother"
Only one can become "queen"
Desire changes these holy women
Into fiends
They take weapons in their hands,
Now surely begins
Mutual slaughter
Survival activates
Paranoia outweighs feelings of friendship
Is the one laughing behind you
Really a friend?
"She died yesterday
Her feet slipped and she fell from a cliff"
Perhaps that is a lie
Who will survive in the end?
A prostitute drowned in sensuality
A noblewoman haughty with arrogance
A jealous girl in love with her brother
And that brother's fiancée
Only the one with the strongest talents
Will get everything
And endless hatred
Wells up in their hearts
Unending survival
The rules of reality outweigh the idea of intrinsic goodness
Is the one aiming at my life
Really an enemy?
"She hanged herself
Heart afflicted by this ugly conflict"
Such a thing is absolutely a lie
Dear sister-in-law,
Let's stop this already
The remaining candidates
Are just us
This is meaningless
As for being queen
It should be you, dear sister-in-law
You who was chosen by my brother
Thank you, Irina
You're safe
I won't let you die
I'll protect you
Flowers of blood bloom from her back
Sister-in-law fell on the spot
What she saw in her dying moment
Was the wailing face of her young sister-in-law
"Sinful girl who by her hands"
"Ended three people,"
"You have been selected"
"As the new 'Ma'"
The girl standing at the altar
A demon smiling like an angel
If she conceived the children
With that, peace would come
Nevertheless, survival
Will never be over, right?
The sword that aimed at the new queen
Gleamed somewhere
Hey darling
Can you hear this voice?
If you can hear this voice
Throw my remains in that ark in the temple
And resurrect me
This country is completely rotten
Everyone's eyes are lost in desire
Everything needs to be reset
With yours and yes, my own hands
The things you can't do as one
If there's two, certainly can be overcome
The whereabouts of the miracle are now in your hands
The forbidden device is beyond this point
If you go now, no one will discover it
Come, hurry
We'll start from here
Without hesitation
Simply continue running
He unlocks the gates of the unknown
To the ark before his eyes, its name is "sin"
What do you wish for
And what will you achieve?
Please, don't be deceived
Hurry and put in
My body, drive it in there!
You'll do it quickly!
You half-wit dumbass
Hurry hurry, inside that...
The die's been cast
That was a miracle that decidedly should not have occurred
The brutal act of he who was manipulated by the "Sin".
The flowers, the people, the country, him
Everything is swallowed up and dissolved
Only the resurrected me left behind
Everything
Lulila, lulila
When I awakened, there was nothing
I who lost everything obtained in compensation
Infinite time
But there's nothing anymore
He and her are already gone
Two dulled lights fell alone
To Held's forest
Sinful man
Come, repent
Hey mother, right now
I'm aiming the muzzle of my gun at a man
A son of a bitch who ruined many people
And filled his own pockets
For the sake of this man, I
Even killed the one I loved
And then I shot myself too, but
I couldn't die
The time has come for my revenge, so
Hello and good-bye 'Mr. Pere Noel'
Your house has been set on fire; select either path:
Will your brow be shot through?
Or will you burn up inside this hellfire?
Hey mother, any scoundrel
Should be granted a chance for atonement, right?
Therefore I said this to him: "Relinquish your fortune to me"
"If you pay back the people from whom you stole everything, if you have just your life, I shall save you"
He replied
You're trash that can't be helped huh?
Even so, repent
Hello and good-bye 'Master of the Court'
A corrupted judge drowned in greed
Let mine and the people's hatred wash over your body
Then sleep
Hey mother, you labored on your own
To raise me
I was born in a deserted house in the forest
I didn't even know my father's face
Hey mother, it seems father is
Already done for, he's insane
He's convinced the doll is my older half-sister
She had already sunken
To the dark bottom of the ocean long ago
I'm now his only daughter, but
Hey father, look at me
Look at me too!
Hello and goodbye... goodbye 'my father'
The boss of hitmen, a corrupted judge
Hey mother, why would you love
Such a man?
With this it's truly over
Let's make everything end
This story of sinful evil
Farewell
The one I hate
Before my eyes is a rectangular black box
In the center of the black box is a small keyhole
A golden key goes inside the keyhole
That key is in the palm of my hand
Bloodthirsty wolves, dead who are skin and bones
Birds dancing in the red sky release strange cries that pierce my ears
Ah, I finally realized
That this place I find myself in now
Is obviously hell itself
Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma
I am master of the hellish yard, the destroyer of hell
This place that shouldn't have existed,
The time has come to return all of it to nothing
The sin divided into seven, and weak-seemingly produced hell
Erasing that that is the mission given by me
If I put in the golden key, all of the stories will end
That final "boy" I'll fire at the forest,
Its name is "punishment"
Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds
This blood smeared hell, "Evillious", shall disappear
An assassin-turned-dictator, when she fired "punishment"
Someone said:
"Now we are all... sons of bitches"
Shadows of the light; while becoming afraid
Inside their vanishing traces, I wait for my mother's return
Avoiding fine weather, while secluded in this hut
Am I really still sane?
"Abandoned, huh?" "You're abandoned"
Someone whispered
You're wrong
Because something like being deserted
Can't be happening to me, right?
Left all alone, I
Little by little quietly start to go mad
By the spare light of the great moon
I can't be illuminated
Am beginning to forget both smiles and tears
The sole feeling left behind
Is overflowing wrath
When I awoke, I was always on my own
It's so frightening I can't sleep
In this room that's covered in darkness as though painted out
I tremble alone
Unlock the door, unlock the door
No matter how many times I shout
That plea isn't granted
Only the invisible twins' voices
Resound
Or maybe this really is
What my mother wants
A female duo advances on a rough road
A lovely sorceress and her apprentice
Seeking the cursed sword, they came from the west
Ah, before their eyes is a long, long wall
If they passed that wall, it would be a short ways to their destination
The female duo draws closer to the wall
Standing there in their way is a lone man
Hey you foreigners! You should take your leave
I was given this order from our great king:
"No one except the people of our country passes through here"
The female duo left from the wall
They paint their hair black, the same color as the man's
Feigning like the country's people, they try to advance
But the man once again shakes his head
"The people of our country's skin isn't such a peculiar white"
They paint their faces with mud, the same skin color as the man's
For sure this time, they try to advance
But the man again shakes his head
"The people of our country's eyes aren't such a ghastly color"
Don't think badly of us, travelers
In order to protect this vast and great country
It's necessary to have this wall and a watchman like me
Having lost her temper, the sorceress
Creates a wind, and the man blows away
The gates of the wall open, and when they proceed ahead
There's nothing there, there was nothing
What that watchman was guarding,
What the heck was it, do you think?
Seeking the cursed sword, they proceed to the east
Ah, before their eyes is a vast, vast ocean
When this sapling has taken root
I think I'll be more of an adult than I am now
When it's grown extremely tall
Will I be alive?
When it's grown many leaves
I think the world will be changing more than it is now
When it's become a splendid, large tree
Will my sins be forgiven?
Will they be forgiven?
Even the span of a millennium
I think to you would be a blink
Surely, surely
I pray, to the base of this tree
For eternal peace
If only you hadn't changed
Running my brush onto the canvas
I painted a picture of him
All along I can't meet with
This face in the corner of my memory anymore
Since when was it that
It had completely changed?
If you had been the way you were
Maybe this would have had a different conclusion
That's too late by now, huh?
The you in the picture isn't around anymore
It's not that I liked your face
And yet this whole time I've continued painting
Before I knew it, this room was filled with your likeness
What I sought wasn't your face
But the real you as you were
But hey, neither you nor I
Was able to realize that
That burnt portrait
You said "I hate this face"
What was truly disgusting
Wasn't your face, surely.
With a foolish idea
I made fun of you
The next time I met you
You had become a different person
Yes, you were just like someone else
Even if you were different from
What I remembered, if you were happy
I had thought perhaps it was okay, even so
It's not that changing is bad
But what you really needed
Was to accept yourself without changing, too
But you couldn't realize that
You continue to live
In these pictures I painted
Even if it's not the appearance
You had wished for
Yes, back then,
Those words you were trying to say in the end
Somehow I know what they were
I had known from long ago
Perhaps I did like you
So this whole time I've continued painting
Before I knew it, this room was filled with memories of you
Seven flowers flutter about, the crime is now unleashed
While my unsightly true face is masked
I continue to drown in lust
Seven seeds rain down, roots will stretch through the ground
The acid of my stomach will melt everything
Yes, even the world
This "Evil's Kingdom" built up on the stone won't stop anymore
The vessels of malice that were unleashed from the cursed twins
What sort of story do they paint?
Seven crimes and punishments
In seven winds the world is violated by poison
The source of everything, a false sin
That laments how she can't sleep today either
In seven springs are traces of the one I love
But different images always get in the way
If only you people weren't around
In the courtroom buried in soil
Come, let's begin this farce named a trial
Everyone is searching for their respective utopia
What kind of conclusion will they meet?
Is it the song of the forest I can hear?
No, that's the gunshot of destruction
If only I hadn't run away
With a weak constitutioned body, wandering between life and death since childhood
An everyday where I continued drinking a secret medicine passed down in my family
I couldn't do what they needed very well; Shunned by my family
As being merely useless, my heart was gradually warped
I didn't have any hope anywhere
They were days of just continuing to live
When I was 15 suddenly there was talk of a marriage alliance
My partner was the daughter of a disgraced nobleman from a foreign country
Almost ignoring such as their mutual reasons, once again I understood
I myself was just a means for a good pedigree
A girl who was fat like a pig
That was my meeting with her
It seemed she, too, spent her girlhood all alone
Her mother dead, her father with a sick heart, and her home fallen to ruin
"Someday I want to travel around the world"
She said that was her dream
I thought going together wouldn't be so bad
They invited guests and held a party for the engagement
It was there I came to know the darkness in her heart
Greedily devouring the food that was brought out like a beggar,
She murmured the words, "If anything's left behind, I'll be scolded"
The abuse she received from her late mother
The engagement was broken off
When time passed, gossip concerning her reached my ears;
"She's become the Evil Food Eater, devourer of gross foods"
I changed my face, disguised myself as a cook and was employed by her
In there was a woman who had become so beautiful I didn't recognize her
A contract with a forbidden demon
She wasn't human anymore
In those days I continue making strange meals, unintentionally these words came from my mouth
"Before long might I take a vacation?" Disappointing her
I know that I've always been a dog running away with his tail between his legs
And again in this way I'm trying to run from her
If I had been able to accept you the day of that party,
Perhaps I could have also saved you
This medicine I can't yet part with, a bottle of fine gold powder
I grasp it, along with my determination
This secret medicine I've been drinking since my childhood
A medicine that becomes a poison if the dosage isn't right
"Let's eat together on this occasion" I invited of her,
And put the poison into two servings of soup
Going together won't be so bad, right?
Come, this is our last supper
-And now I'm one of the meals lined up on the dinner table
The poison didn't work on her
I was the only one who died
Just before I lost consciousness she said with a sigh,
"You've run away again, leaving me"
Having become cuisine for you I'm headed to your stomach
And so I'll become your blood, I'll become your flesh
I won't be escaping from you anymore will I?
I'll be with you forever
If only I hadn't forgotten
At Enbizaka in the center of Onigashima,
At the execution site atop the hill, is a head on display
Her long, bloodstained hair blowing in the wind,
Smoothly, smoothly flowing side-to-side
What kind of crime did this head commit?
The monk who didn't know asked someone
It was said the owner of a clothing shop and his family
Were stabbed with scissors by that woman
The beautiful woman of this ballad,
Why did she murder those people?
This weathered woman doesn't say anything
Yes, the head on display at Onigashima
Memorials for criminals are also the monk's duty
He again visited the top of Enbizaka the next day
The prior visitor before the head is a lone child
What kind of person is he?
The child answered the monk's question
He cut off her head himself
She was a sinful woman but pitiful
They joined their hands together and recited the rites
She was a skilled tailor
It's said she weaved elegant kimono
Even so, she lacks the arms to hold scissors anymore
Yes, the head on display at Enbizaka
No matter how beautiful the kimono,
She can't wear them without a body
A tiny, tiny seed of malice that wriggled inside the beaker
One of the fragments that it gave birth to, his name is Hansel
If his body should rot away, he'll be reborn any number of times
That was the doing of gods, as a prank of demons
Once the child of a woodcutter living in the forest, he tossed the evil witch into the stove
Once the servant of gluttony, he was a dim-wit in charge of livestock
Once more the Fifth Pierrot, he was the son of the great Santa Claus
And his true colors are as an apostle of the ending that will become canon
On a night when the full moon shines, Hansel will appear
Holding a deadly weapon tinged with light in his hands,
Whether that's a silver knife, or a glass bottle
That depends on you standing before his eyes
This tiny, tiny world created by the four pillar gods
This millennial kingdom that should have eliminated malice
Four different endings were prepared in the rules,
What the boy holds in his hands may just decide them
The Master of the Graveyard brings death, everything goes to her stomach
The Master of the Court brings the trial, everything receives judgment
The Master of the Hellish Yard brings hell, no one will ever be able to be forgiven
The Master of the Heavenly Yard brings atonement; they may show the way to Utopia
Any of the endings may come to the world
That certainly can't be avoided
The established conclusion, or the distorted Irregular
Punishment will be given to all equally
Crossing the time span of a millennium, Hansel will appear
While not knowing his own destiny
Whether he'll become an angel, or an insane familiar
The large temple where my mom and dad sleep
The dark legacy called "Sin"
The Third world, governed by
A country built over a graveyard
The name of I, standing at the top, is
Alice Merry-Go-Round
Queen of the glass
Who will reflect and indicate the future
Even if that's not the truth
I'm a failure prophet
.And so history is being warped
Mother, in order to meet you both
Father, what should I do?
Please tell to me
The method to change gods into humans
There was a revelation from my mom and dad
That was reflected in the small glass bottle
A god given message
"Our dear daughter Alice, you will make our divine vessel similar to the time you once made Adam"
A false prediction of the future
.And so the world is being warped
Mother, occasionally I grow uneasy
Father, I'm really your daughter, aren't I?
I'm not just a doll, am I?
Mother, this is the correct choice isn't it?
Father, I don't understand
Not this me without a heart
Not this me without life
Barisol's son is an only child
An heir to a wealthy household, and a beautiful boy everyone envies
But there was a problem with him
He loves to play with dolls, and he only wears girl clothes
He steals implements from his mother's room and secretly puts on makeup
Everyone around him kept their distance from him as such
So he was always
All alone
Barisol's daughter is an only child
A once-in-a-millennium child prodigy
Entering college at age six, she studies about the heart of man
Unending crimes and wars; why do people hate each other so?
So that she could understand that even a little, she continued with her research
And so she realized the cause of the unending 'Malice'
She knew, 'That's not in this world'
He too finally took up a sweetheart, a maid his age who came to work for him
She was adorable like a doll
"I'd like you to let me wear your clothes,"
One day he requested of her
While becoming terribly flustered
"That's disgusting" was her only reply
She too was beginning to be violated by 'Malice'
Having unending murder impulses without knowing why, she consulted with a colleague
A researcher of parallel worlds
The man made this reply to her:
"If you can erase your 'other self', then perhaps your 'malice' can be erased as well"
From outside the door was an angry voice
In a corner of the room, he was growing afraid
The dolls scattered inside the room, their limbs were warm and in pieces
There was another world in the mirror that his eyes had been able to see
A woman who resembled himself extended a hand
When the world was consumed by "Malice", an ark flew into the cosmos
With a crew of 72 people, inside of that it's said there were also twins
Just before she would kill 'herself', she realized the truth
That this was a clever trap that man had devised
When I do this myself, that really would be the gateway to 'Malice'
With me fallen, he likely intended to ride on the ark in my place
Barisol's child is an only child
But nowadays they're two children
The older sister knowing the heart of man and the younger brother knowing the body of man
The ark advances along a black sea, aiming for a new paradise
Their research might create a new mankind someday
"This song that you have heard somewhere, do you remember it?"
Approaching me as I was dying
Was a male scientist who asked me that
He tossed in front of me the remains of a red cat
That he was carrying in his arms
Looking closer,
It was a plushie made of cloth and iron
"After this you will be reborn, today is your Re_Birthday"
With arms covered in burns, he touched
'What used to be me'
A light shines into the dark sky
Looking at it, I remember
Yes, this was formerly such a song
If the era changes, then the song will change again too
My heart hasn't changed
My body became a red cat
I wouldn't be dying anymore, but
I won't be returning to human anymore either
They couldn't become double
What should I live for from now on?
Before disappearing, he said
"I won't return here again, continue with your experiments"
Seven lights scatter about in the southern sky
Looking at them, I remember
Yes, I'll live for retribution against the woman who stole everything!
On the night of a new moon my revenge begins
If my body changes, my goal will change too
This time I'll turn people "evil"
This song that I have heard somewhere
Eventually it'll become a different song again won't it?
In a town that fell to ruin at the end of a battle
A lone knight walks through
He'd earned more military gains than anyone
He'd killed more people than anyone
The people of the enemy nation fear his form
And they desperately beg for their lives
But he never
Grants their wish
A woman's corpse tightly held
An innocently smiling baby
With cold eyes
He lifted his sword
A hero's armor is always crimson
That is surely the color of the spilled blood he basked in
Even if these are deeds for someone's sake
Can you call that "justice"?
Five years flowed on since then
And the battle continues today
Waiting for the knight at a temporary home
Is a lone, sweet girl
Back then he'd noticed stitched on her clothes
Was the Imperial family's crest
If he had her on hand, one day
She might be useful as a hostage
Foolish, innocent girl
Who smiles and says "Welcome home, Dad"
You do this even though I myself am the one
Who killed your parents
That is surely the same color as his treachery
On the battlefield
Various things are
Running rampant
Victory, defeat, hatred, chance luck
And betrayal
Before he knew it, the knight
Was surrounded by a great many enemies
It was obvious that
They weren't ordinary soldiers
"Quietly submit to us that girl,"
Urged an old woman in black clothes
If he complied,
They would probably murder her
But for the knight
That must have been a desired outcome
Because it was for that reason
He'd been keeping her until now
There was someone who held a sword
And stood in front of the knight to protect him
A small, trembling back
It was the young girl.
Pitiful girl
You do this even though the one you love as a father
Was just about to try selling you off
After the knight gently patted the girl's head
He faced the assassins and drew his sword...
That is surely the color of the twilight he basked in
Walking hand-in-hand in that bloodstained era,
Is a knight and a girl
On the battlefield there is neither justice nor evil
The day of atonement will come someday
Until that time finally arrives
He's decided to be a "father"
That girl, someone raised by a witch
A silver sparrow, the "Neomaria of the inverted gravestone"
To simply kill people without emotion
That was her doctrine, the doctrine of the witch of chaos
Everything was an experiment, and also a beginning
The one to prefix "N", a prototype assassin
Her entire family had been burned up by blue flames
A caravan
Advancing on an eastern desert
Suddenly
Disappeared one day
That was
Her first job
The assassin's dagger of the inverted gravestone
A girl who had her name
Etched into a gravesite by birth
That girl, a murderer doll
Today's target, a red garbed fugitive
Who betrayed his country, and killed his sibling
The witch told her "Promptly erase him"
At the top of a cliff, she ambushes her target
The marked red clothes showed themselves
A boy who wasn't that much older than her
For the first time some slight feelings of doubt were born in her
Her feet slipped
She fell from the cliff
Her consciousness
Gradually blurred
The boy wearing red
Drew closer
He
Had his sword drawn
When she woke up she'd lost her memories
The girl stopped in the wasteland, on her body the traces of medical care
Eventually she was picked up by a traveling group
That was the carriage of a chivalric order who belonged to a certain country
She forgot
Both her sins and her malice
And walked along
A new life
Relying on
Her faint memories
She went by the name
Of "Mariam"
But there's no one now
Who knows that name
I can't rewind time
The gears will turn on
Until the spring snaps
These days where I stave off boredom
That's just what life is
That's what I thought
What I thought
In the vicinity of that bridge
I met you all
And something changed
The mere whim of
A rebellious witch
.Probably
We assemble around an eccentric king
Unsteady heroes
The words of our vow
Even those in pieces
If you have any troubles
I'll at least give you advice
Because I'm currently
Pointlessly leading a long life
The bridge connects this great land
As well as people's hearts
Surely that's so
.Maybe that's so
A moderate suggestion
Everyone laughs
I laughed too
Surely even something like fate
Can be changed
We all have our own way, but we are the trinity
That's all we need
The river flows on
And we too continue forward
From a bat fluttering in the sky
I came to hear a song of the spring.
A clumsy knight
A scary-eyed assassin
A bath-hating witch
Surely even fate
Right now, we
Swear an oath on that bridge
When a thousand blades and three heroes
Got together with that king
They would become a troupe that would
Establish justice and crush evil
No one knowing that that king
Who advanced through the vanguard
With his gold hair flying in the wind
Was one only feigning humanity
That man born from polluted mud, even so
Today too goes onto the battlefield for humanity's sake
A mud soldier that pushes onward
With his comrades in arms, keeping his fate in his chest
He's not fighting to be loved
He's fighting out of love
Are tormented by despair
Even if the day comes where his body
Cracks and crumbles away
Indeed, he'll go
Simply for justice
There was someone who said to him,
"Even if you have no blood running through your body
I'll be by your side"
And the two were joined together
His heart that loved humanity
Performed a miracle
Today too he goes
For the sake of his born children
We have done nothing but
Make mistakes
During these thousand years
A wish of "if only"
Will never be granted now
Punishment has been passed down
You several hundred million souls
You several hundred million villains
Is this unhappy conclusion someone's fault?
Those who think so are all "sons of bitches"
In the end
Have we left something behind?
In this thousand year journey
The answer will surely
Never come forward
So I will go to see you
In the center of the ruined world
A theater floats in the wasteland
The dead spirits gather together
And worship a black box
Their master, the male gardener,
Gives orders to the souls
There are things they need to do
In order to save the world
Destroy the souls possessed by demons
Kill the cause of everything, the "deadly sin contractors"
His spirit followers start to move
"The hunt for the Deadly Sins" has now begun
Before the princess
Are her deeply sleeping ministers
That is a "gift" from someone
The one who could protect her
Is gone now
The gardener's troops approach
The nun that appeared riding a white horse
Helps get the princess away
Towards a new journey
I'm fed up
With only waiting
I hate always being protected
If I accomplish everything
All on my own
I'll puff up my chest with pride
And go to see you
"Just what in the world is evil?"
The ones burdened with the seven sins
Should have been destroyed along with the world
But they are still
Living
Can sins never be forgiven?
There is one who raised her voice
To stop the gardener's ambitions
The heroes and the commoners
Take up phantom swords
Justice, and evil,
Let's change all of it into a song
Because punishment has already been handed down
So now is the time
Where we shall fight
So that our mistakes don't repeat again
The forbidden black box
Will now be opened
Its power is the purification of gods
Or a reset
People's souls are after all
Little more than pieces of data
The springs of the black box go around
And everything melts away
You can't defy that vortex
That's an unchanging program of the gods
Because there is no one aside from a god
Who can stop it
In this world only one person
Has continued to live
From her gun was fired
A golden bullet
Who is she thinking of
While continuing to gaze at
The black fireworks dancing in the sky?
Signaling that the old era of the gods
Has ended
And
Time begins to move again
This is the story of the end
My name is......
......Who am I?
She'd arrived at the theater
To the princess, this place was
Where the mastermind lived
And an old home
Those like the gardener are puppets after all
The enemy she truly ought to defeat was
The one who dwelled in the doll
The girl of the miniature garden
Ah, Gear, why
Do you protect her?
Even though she's
Not the one you long for
If you say you will get in the way
I shall not be kind to you
For I am the prideful princess
I am The Daughter of Evil
Finally, the time has arrived
That is the Heartbeat Clocktower, sin carved into its hands
No matter what kind of person they are
If they oppose me, completely purge them
"Come, kneel to me!"
I had always wanted to go see you
Yes, your name is.
Ma
The boy who had searched for the princess
She was inside his older sister
The witch who had taken in the seven demons
Seeking to be a truly pure being
Just before vanishing, the doll
Resurrected the witch's will
While being pulled into the black box,
In the end, the gardener cried out this:
If you want to save the world, then kill that girl
Kill The Daughter of Evil who assimilated the witch
He is urged to a final decision
Boy, which will you choose?
Those are someone's words
All people are greedy
Because I myself
Am the same
The world and you; I will
Obtain both
My strong determination brought about
A miracle on a whim
A small bottle fell from your hand
The message that you had written
"You have to save me"
I quietly laugh that it's so like you
It's alright because I will
Protect you unconditionally
The world isn't our enemy anymore
Come, let's join hands
Let's move forward
For the new world
And for you
Here, look at the sky
The world is a mirror that reflects the moon
It is time
For you who is looking our way
From beyond there
To awaken
The setting sun sinks down, sin rules the night
It's a final supper that never ends
There was nothing new in the food lined up before her
She had already grown tired of eating it all
The evil food eater finally stopped eating
Gazing at a vast wasteland that stretched outside her window
It was a world with nothing in it, its time stopped
It would soon be time to set sail
Come, we journey to a new world
The master of the hellish yard's mask, the friend of the dark butler
He knew the way to a parallel world
The new ship is the second theater
With a black box stowed inside it
The fourth period the master of the heavenly yard will make
Will likely become
Something similar to everything up to now
We've decided not to enter that door
Let us take a different road
Floating theater, advance through the sky
My aim is new evil foods I have not yet seen
Come, research new stimuli unknown to my tongue
In this Gluttonomy
This is my concerto
Preparations for transit through space complete
Course set, accelerating ultraphotic flow
Deploy all hands, prepare for the shock
Departure in progress, are conditions favorable?
A strange incident, the alarm sounds
The meter's flashing, the shaking's increasing
The controls are shot, the cause unknown
The power's out, we're going to crash
The ship is in chaos! Escape is futile!
Emergency repair! The result is failure!
The fuel's exploding!! Survival is hopeless!!
We have eyes on our objective
Full speed ahead!!!
At the end of her distant journey
What will she see, and what will she eat?
Come, bring new stimuli unknown to her tongue
Along with her friends and "him"
That is Banica's concerto
A black dawn
Time turns back
Everything ends
And then begins
The Re_birthday came too early
Ah, but
The karma of evil will not end
The day where I forgive you
Will not come
I will forever hate you
And I will forever love you
This too is another prologue
What I saw with my own eyes
And what I heard, all of it
I shall convey as a prophecy
The gods are gone now
I'll do this over again any number of times
And then someday I will bring
True salvation to this world
Under the third moon, gathered around a great tree
Let's sing now
Lulila lulila
So that it might reach you
The flowing time always urges us
Along on our journey
But someday
That will strongly change you
This quickly pounding beat in our chests
Our springs won't stop
Lulilalulila lulilalulila
As long as our singing voices
We will wake from our sleep and the dream will surely become reality
We will open the door to tomorrow
Stepping firmly on the ground as cherry blossom petals fly around us
Let's all sing together
So that it might reach the sky
There are a lot of sad things
And a lot of painful memories
But that too
Is part of the path we will walk
These springs deep in our chests
From here on out we will turn them ourselves
Without knowing what lies in wait beyond the door
We will push forward
The reality that continues to stand in our way
May wound us every now and then
Even so, it is for that reason
That people live with all they are
The world doesn't need to be a utopia
Lulilalalala lala lalulilala lala
Lulila lalala la
Lalala la
Lulila lulilalala
Lulila lulila lalulila
Lulila lalalala
Hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai
Lulila lulila lulilalala
Lulila lulila lulila lulilala
Lulila lulila lulilala
Lulilalulila
Lulilala
Lulilalala
Lulililalala
Lulililala
Lulilalulilala
Lalalalalalala lalala
The flames born from the yellow phosphorus
This sinful body is burned to the ground
In order to get a loaf of bread
"Could you please buy my matches?"
No one even turned their heads
Freezing away all my hopes
This cold weather causes my body to shiver
Yearning for just a small amount of warmth
I lighted a fire on the tip of the match
Beyond the wavering, I saw an illusion
Please show me the recollection of my happiness
Warm this body and soul
Once I return to reality there was
The loneliness of the unsold
Until I sell all the matches
My father won't let me eat anything
I don't want the hunger and the coldness anymore
So I lit the house my father waited in fire
Beyond the wavers, I saw a picture
Burn away, my thousand sufferings
I carried away from the burnt house
With those coins I bought a loaf of bread
It is an unforgivable grave sin
My body is tied up
The executioner, at my feet,
Lighted a fire
I just wanted to eat a loaf of bread
But even that wasn't allowed
The flames from the yellow phosphorus
Burn away this body and soul
Beside an impure lake,
A magic tower is built up
On the top floor
Sleeps the secret towards immortal life
In there lived three sisters:
Gibbet, Rack, and Maiden
Greedy invaders
Have become these sisters' prey
The eldest sister does the hanging,
The next sister stretches them,
The third sister locks the victim inside
In emptiness, lament, scream, resound
The tower of torture never sleeps
It's alright, since your soul
Cannot be saved
The great father left a will,
And the inheriting sisters fulfilled the duty
It's alright, since the pain
Will continue eternally
The father called the minister of torture
The daughters that he loved
"Make offerings to the unsightly gods"
"The plundered souls, that is"
When the god revived,
The sisters' wish will be granted
Give punishment for crimes
That is definitely not the wrong thing to do
Gibbet does the hanging
Rack stretches them
Maiden locks the victim inside
On the earth, lament, scream, resound
The tower of torture doesn't sleep
It's alright, since your flesh
Will be annihilated
If it weren't a dirties soul
God certainly wouldn't be happy
It's alright, the anguish
Will turn to pleasure eventually
The street corner clown speaks:
The minister of torture had no daughters,
In the tower, there are only
The torture instruments he left behind
Someone appearing anguished
Delighted the minister of torture
How could something painful be good
Those sisters did not doubt this
In emptiness, lament, scream, resound,
When music began to perish from this world
Two infinity mirrors floated down from heaven
The first tone is already being played
What begins next is the tale of the golden messengers
No matter how tragic the tune, let us sing it
Working closely in tandem, when we're together the truth is visible
What is your wish?
Glory or tragedy?
If we two will sing
It will settle everything
Don't worry about how well the lines are sung
Everyone has their weak points
The melody echoes and resounds together
Please believe in the divine protection of the infinity mirrors
The people swarm to the messengers, seeking salvation
They tried to make them sing the tunes that pleased them
The messengers never refuse, they'll sing any song
For that is their mission
The mirrors continue to reflect humanity's true nature
Eventually the messengers lost their wings
"We don't mind that", the messengers' faces were bright
Because that is proof that we have become close to humans
Believe in the divine protection of the infinity mirrors
If we seem to be evil
That is surely your own form
We are little more than infinity mirrors
Mirrors that reflect the truth
Come, let's sing and dance together
Continue to let out your desire
It was a cold night
As we love such a quiet night,
We peek "below"
Although it's a quiet night, there are rascals getting in the way
The ones crawling around "below",
Those rascals called humans
Humans never rest
They work even through the dead of night
The trains they run stand along that railway line
Today again two factories
Are always quarreling
Which of their smoke stacks' smoke rises the highest?
The smoke they belch forth
Was inhaled into lungs
A boy selling newspapers collapsed from illness
The boy is poor,
So he couldn't go to any hospital
In the bed in his home,
He clutches his chest, coughing
From his wooden apartment window, the boy
Was watching us
On the next night it seemed
That boy's sister added on to her work
For her brother's medical bills
She chose a job in the cotton mill
Next to that factory was a paper mill
To compete today too they continue to belch forth smoke
The black smoke rises up high until the sky where we are
It turns to black clouds,
And conceals the top of the factory
Because of the factory where the girl works
We can't see
Humans gave us the name of "stars"
And they pray and wish, but
That doesn't mean that we
Can cause miracles, does it?
From this sky we
Are only watching
The girl works at a factory to pay his medical bills
The black smoke rises up high
Until the sky where we are
