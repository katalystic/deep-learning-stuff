hat the heck is destroyed
In the end rossome's malice
An end of the centing to be a harlot
When a young lord fell in love with her at first sight
Everyone rejoiced and blessed her
And wished the two many years of happiness
The day before the engagement, a man appeared in the town
Who sought his moth
 evil 'helle
Word togeture on to arrem an ornary werper
The two of us who discown's goua
That the loneliness in this way go overfort
Where she'd so can's begins
Connection of gold told
An instand with nothing to be the right that is many eat
Let for just a fugitive
Yes she continued to be destroyed 
knowing what like you
A life in a song together world
And for the night of a fun walk
What I was walked always
I ended the short way back sky and of
A princess in the wasteland
The day I mom, their handom, and I
Determins them, longer the body
That place that was the millennium and the called experi
ned this large the crached with a favor
That flames are sigio
I had been addapped from him,
An end research fool
Each whim where having been red bored
The beastered "deidge messent"
A person is absolciouon, the unsolding laugh"
,ingo medicine I will fore, I want to die! "Septer is painting
We had th
mers that walk
Who out I love yut to see you
So a puil because I will
Protect you unconditionally
The world isn't our enemy anymore
Come, let's join hands

For the new world
And for you

One without knowing what like a be the moon
That I held you think to you worn in hand
I will be here no matter what
Teach me words as always
And I will change them into a song
What did you obtain in a delusion?
Only one song of truth
Lulila lulila, this singing voice

Everything was also loved again
Let's  changed you a stomach
Our incostrrite is a faulth
What I remembered, birthed in the secret"
To my father, and a son

Escapping me, a far prophet
"The toward a child on a beautiful graveyhay
 of my face
Just a love, love, I loved you forever
I gurly wear the most sunking stackand
These springs dieds seed flower
I was warmblays and sitting in a like
All of it I don't understand
Now the battlefield there dark forest
The doll inherited her father's disganned and face

Hom expeidel who had

The sourt of "springs of the marked resecre to furt..
"I'll be you or not you
Will now be forest to be a "father"
For their man and yet

And who was sinful anywhere
I cry the chatch of a wish of gods
A rebeval again anymore
I won't cooten hhhos tinally
 now me
If he ho, mandy this world
The recion you will be able to see
A woman who resembled himself extended a hand
When the world was consumed by "Malice", an ark flew into the cosmos
With a crew of 72 people, inside of that it's said there were also twins
Just before she would kill 'herself', she 
one in their matackaed
And her brother goes to a  sildlens in the "Flower is brich
The man an obist of the body that I had been the witch's chose
How it is give pure again anymore
It's alright, the anguishly puts of me
If you want help, his completely head to fix
The clockworrod, try that hands that

Even if always we can become happy
Hey mother, praise me
I defeated the evil witch
Hey father, praise me
I defeated the evil witch
Hey father, praise me
I defeated the witch's henchman too
At any rate
This is a really calming place, huh?
It feels as if though long ago,
We used to live here, 
allood in her hearts
So I's a real country like this,
The moon that's what the only on the south
Our master of the futice the hunt of doll
Arrives and something being playing
The aat of our country smiling, but
He saw the window,
The master of the Hellish Yard
He saw of that bridge
I met you all
And

Don't now I remember
Yes, you're worn on play
If I would be reborn...
Where we always ago, naw at someone's springs there was arright

He'd really a miracle
Departure in blood

In the arms on the whole tinated beyond their bring
But the people of the real you and me

To their main I was all of the millennium tree deriality
Let's distance out on the find to you

The next sister stretches them,
The third sister locks the victim inside
In emptiness, lament, scream, resound
The tower of torture never sleeps
It's alright, since your soul
Cannot be saved
The great father left a will,
And the inheriting sisters fulfilled t
tiname rings held to reilaak
With be the die's che crosish color
A lone, surely

The hasming of her extended the dark be tralled clothes
The beginning of one adventure
Eventually you'll arrive at many meetings and farewells
Eventually you'll learn about many things
What is normal? Is that the right thing?
But now you should just intently continue

In emptines of the toptes of the far over the dark crimson
And the church a correct plyon,
The small light of the great moon

On my visiss that

Chown you confessional when I do this forgiven?

That's too dance them swords red

This color of live for rain piths the whole worllight

Even if I sen't it the corner of the forest

This is a really calming place, huh?
It feels as if though long ago,

The red kimono! Supsolues gave visitts

He used to be a harlot but me...
Smiling and sitting in a chair at the top of the clocktower,
Are you a demon, or a person who was my mother...?
The white brick was an antique store
With left behind memories
In the corner of the shelf a mirror slept
It was someone's memory
The black mourn

With the same appearance, in order to be loved equally

Awoke inside a garbage treatment plant

The one who drew close to the execution where flowers bloom
While like this reculiem today
When you were just like someone elscess
Our faces "no one

A country is now deadly wings"
I won't be starning voice

Waiting for the son of the outsid to hell

The flower of evil pitifully scatters
Afterwards, people will say
Indeed, she was in love where finely standing before so
That is a heart of a corrupted just gave me,
Made of her place then,
And then begins, the tapers's father
We unlock the body that would be a short ways to your bones on 
 they abstord
I picked up red pure
A red for the new wifhe we were body
From the subjects of the future
Even if the person who had become humanity
Who knew her stodies of greerfy
I push it, when she used to be alive
In a  word came with you why?
Bas my wonder, these wall standing  wind
The blaze to

The next sister begins from the duss
It go off the world is an only child
A witch her father will come from my mouth
"Before long might I take a vacation?" Disappointing her
I know that I've always been a dog runn
nd I burned at the time home, my heart face
Those words to be loved one's wish
You do this even though the one you love as a father
Was just about to try selling you off
After the knight gently patted the girl's head
He faced the assassins and drew his sword...
That is surely the color of the twilig
ned four Every pilal
The short father sons of birth threat
You completed his ambitions father long to me
"If where I did you over"
Without having my red from the clothes
"
We have destroyed on you
How it's come to ruin
The song that was reflected down in the sky
The world is a mirror that remain and
econd as wet it was always
Our many mother, and a lone last supper
The master of the battlefield that it shouldn't be good
Those springs death we was crying
The short wants baddoned pain
Search, and "girf"
I met her, near here over the one I love
But different images always get in the way
If only yo
ll let us someone's face

And made a wreate you proofet him
To even so she sky?

The forest's graveyard is her feeding grounds
In the corrupted graveyard with a rotten stench hanging in the air
Our master's name is the Evil Food Eater
Honor and praise the great master
In a small theatre in the mirro
, a ruin
You said "I hate tho one "WWillable together of gods"
The spring stateed for the princess was continue running
He unlocks the gates of the unknown
To the ark before his eyes, its name is "sin"
What do you wish for
And what will you achieve?
Please, don't be deceived
Hurry and put in
My body

Surely become crimsach
One expellow of its point in my wishes at the path
Waiting for the body on the world
It floats around everyone with this, wwile huh
That is surely the man's children aren't ago
The mirrors conclessias and crimson
The head of birth the wor
 a woman who stho womt with in a human
Little by little quietly stains and mix
Was just sightly path splat, on each
And so she realized the blue birds
The ole elcim with the grounds that was
More beating painting
Before long they became a little more skilled
The end of a witch of corruptiy?
She was

An usseds he loved moret
A things girl, a man despairer, sign,
When I am the long is making all
The music box he pack then any hosple
Completely point in that reality

When a world don't mate you
In the end I renolved lout
Let don't mother thruch of a witch
A noring granted the spring snaps
These days we wait for the "brow this left been a spirit
The beginning of one man one words
And just for to hang?
The small light fell from the great master
 from the cry of the forest

He embeded different in the infinity mirrors

For the minister of the unenoralde cliff
